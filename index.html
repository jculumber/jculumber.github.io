        <p>I tend to introduce myself as Jennifer, but really prefer to be called Jenn. I am originally from Miami, Florida, and moved to Orlando in 2006 after graduating with my masters in Communication Sciences and Disorders from the University of Florida. Since then, I have been working as a speech-language pathologist in the public school system and home-health. I have been married for almost 11 years, and have an 8-year-old daughter and 5-year-old son. Two cats complete our family.</p>
